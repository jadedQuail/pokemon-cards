# Pokemon Cards Web App

This is a simple project that I created with the intention of learning more about Vue as a front-end framework, and for practicing full-stack development in general. In addition to using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) as the front-end,
I am using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) as the backend. I am currently using [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) as my database management system (running a server locally on my machine), but I plan to host a database somewhere, eventually.

## Set Up

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a `.env` file in both the **front-end** and **back-end** folders.
    - Use the `.env.example` files as templates. You need to fill in the proper information for each of those variables.
